    <p>And, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'<br>
They wishin' on me, yeah</p>
<p>I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me<br>
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me<br>
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me<br>
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me<br>
I don't wanna die for them to miss me<br>
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me<br>
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<br>
They gon' tell the story, <s>shit</s> was different with me</p>

I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry"<br>
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me<br>
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party<br>
And you know me<br>
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog<br>
Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me<br>
'Magine if I never met the broskis</p>

I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy<br>
Might go down as G-O-D, yeah, wait<br>
